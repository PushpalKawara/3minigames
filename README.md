## 📌 Overview  

The **Unified Game Analytics Dashboard (3-in-1 Tool)** is an **all-in-one solution** to analyze and visualize player behavior across **levels, events, and game stages**.  

This **Streamlit-powered toolkit** combines **three dashboards into one interface**:  

1. 📊 **Daily Progression Game Metrics Dashboard** – Analyze retention & ad event impact  
2. 🎮 **Game Progression Dashboard** – Track stage-level player movement & bottlenecks  
3. 📉 **All Game Levels Analyzer** – Deep dive into drop-off & retention curves  

> Inspired by my work as a **Game Analyst Intern**, I created this to automate repetitive tasks and provide actionable insights in minutes instead of hours.  

⚠️ *Note: No company data or assets were used. This is a personal project built purely for learning & demo purposes.*
