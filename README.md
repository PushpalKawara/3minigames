# Mini-Games Collection

A collection of five simple, offline-playable mini-games built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to be easily accessible and playable directly from a mobile browser.

## Games Included:

1.  **Snake:** Navigate a snake to eat food and grow longer.
2.  **Tic-Tac-Toe:** A classic two-player game on a 3x3 grid.
3.  **Memory Match:** Flip cards to find matching pairs.
4.  **2048:** Slide tiles to merge them and reach the 2048 tile.
5.  **Flappy Bird:** Tap to make the bird fly and avoid pipes.

## Features:

* **Offline Play:** Once loaded, all games are fully functional without an internet connection.
* **Mobile-Ready:** Optimized for use on mobile devices.
* **Simple Navigation:** A central home screen allows you to choose and play any game, with a "Back to Home" button on each game page.
* **Extendable:** The project structure makes it easy to add more games in the future.

## How to Use:

1.  **Create a Repository:** On your mobile device, create a new public GitHub repository.
2.  **Add Files:** Add the files and folders as structured in the repository. You can do this directly on the GitHub website or using a mobile code editor app.
3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:** Go to your repository's **Settings** -> **Pages**. Select the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder, then click **Save**.
4.  **Play:** Your games will be live at a URL like `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name`. Share this link and enjoy!

## Adding New Games:

To add a new game, simply create a new folder inside the main directory (e.g., `newgame/`), place your HTML, CSS, and JS files inside, and then add a new link to `index.html`.
